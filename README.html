<h1><strong>GSAP UI pack</strong></h1>

<h3>What is this repository for?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ever used Velocity.js? Love its UI capabilities? This is an attempt to replicate those quick transitions and shortcuts for the considerably faster GSAP. Also GSAP is backwards compatible to IE6.</li>
<li>1.0a</li>
</ul>


<h3>How do I get set up?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Include the script after you&rsquo;ve included GSAP</li>
<li>Call gsui(&lsquo;transition.transitionName&rsquo;, $el, {options [optional]});</li>
<li>For more details on the available transitions, option &amp; to see working examples, see below.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Contribution guidelines</h3>

<p>If you have any suggestions, issues or anything else feel free to file something. I can&rsquo;t dedicate buckets of time to this&ndash;I&rsquo;m just creating it to speed my workflow and thought I&rsquo;d share the love in case anyone else can make good use of it. I will periodically update it though as I enhance the script and discover bugs. I hope it helps somebody else!</p>

# **GSAP UI pack** #

I'll be updating this very shortly--it wasn't ready for release when I initially comitted it, but I don't have premium so it had to be public. I'll be updating this quite soon, with vastly enhanced functionality and rather extensive documentation. I really would like this to help others the way it has me.

### What is this repository for? ###

* If you've ever used Velocity.js and you're anything like me, the main thing you probably loved about it was having the UI pack, for catalysing common front-end transitions. This is an attempt to replicate those quick transitions and shortcuts for the considerably more performant and better supported GSAP. GSAP is backwards compatible to IE6, and can be great for doing some pretty freaky things for IE variants of a site right up to version 8, that simply weren't possible with CSS.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Include the script after you've included GSAP
* Call gsui('transition.transitionName', $el, {options [optional]});
* For more details on the available transitions, option & to see working examples, see below.

### Documentation ###

So, it's piqued your interest? Here are a series of useful points of information about the parameters GSUI can take and I'll explore some other aspects about what it's capable of, what it isn't yet capable of etcetera.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Any ideas for presets
* Any ideas for features
* Ideas for improving performance

If you have any suggestions, issues or anything else feel free to file something. I can't dedicate buckets of time to this--I'm just creating it to speed my workflow and thought I'd share the love in case anyone else can make good use of it. I will periodically update it though as I enhance the script and discover bugs. I hope it helps somebody else!
